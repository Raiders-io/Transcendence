### Requirements

You will need at least :

* `docker` (with docker compose)
* `admin permissions` if you want to modify the `/etc/hosts` file (and use the URL, `https://raiders.io/`, instead of `https://127.0.0.1/`)

### Install the project

To install this project you can use the following commands :

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Raiders-io/Transcendence.git
```

Or using `https://` instead of ssh -> `https://github.com/Raiders-io/Transcendence.git`

> /!\ Please don't use the 'Download ZIP button' as it will NOT download the entire project (submodules will be empty). /!\

If you already cloned it and you forgot the `--recurse-submodules`, you can initialize the sub-modules with the following command :

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Update the sub-modules

If you want to use a new version of your sub-module, you can use :

```bash
git submodule update --remote [name]
```

Optional : `name`, update only the given remote.

## <a name="arch-en">🔧 Architecture

See the [ARCH.md in docs/](docs/ARCH.md).

## <a name="use-en">🚀 How to use

Currently, you need to execute to go in each submodules, and execute the following command :

```sh
make env
```

It should configurate the project environment and prepare for the full build.
When you finished, enter in the `deployment` directory, and execute :

```sh
make build-all
```

When everything is ready, it should be accessible through `https://localhost/` and `https://$(hostname)/`.
