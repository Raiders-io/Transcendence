# Transcendance Frontend

## Usage

The following command builds the frontend and transpiles typescript into javascript into the `dist` folder. It copies all files from `public` and tries to optimize all pictures for size. It also generate the sitemap through a script.

```sh
make build
```

The following command just propagate the `make` command to it's parent project ([deployment](https://github.com/Raiders-io/deployment)). It auto builds and gives the files directly to nginx through a shared volume via docker compose.

```sh
make deploy
```

THe following command lint the code, ignoring files in the 'src/component/ui' folder as they are provided by Shadcn and shouldn't be modified.

```sh
make lint
```
